# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.  
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand customer behavior and target them effectively through data-driven strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To group customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior using **unsupervised machine learning**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Dataset

The Dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

The dataset includes customer-related attributes such as:
- Customer ID
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Determining optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method  
4. Applying K-Means clustering  
5. Visualizing customer segments  

---

## 📊 Results
- Customers are grouped into meaningful clusters
- Each cluster represents a distinct customer segment
- Visualizations clearly show customer distribution

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
1. Clone the repository:  
[https://github.com/Bhargavi4125/ML-Project.git](https://github.com/Bhargavi4125/ML-Project.git)



2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd ML-Project

3. Open and run the notebook:
```bash
Customer_Segmentation_using_K_Means_Clustering.ipynb

📊 Results

Customers are segmented into meaningful clusters

Each cluster represents a unique customer group

Clear visualizations help understand customer behavior

🚀 Future Enhancements

Try advanced clustering techniques (DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)

Add more customer attributes for better segmentation

Deploy as a web application
