# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**.  
Customer segmentation helps businesses understand customer behavior and target them effectively through data-driven strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To group customers into different segments based on their purchasing behavior using **unsupervised machine learning**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes customer details such as:
- Customer ID
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

*(Used for learning and academic purposes)*

---

## ⚙️ Steps Followed
1. Data loading and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Finding optimal clusters using Elbow Method  
4. Applying K-Means clustering  
5. Visualizing customer segments  

---

## 📊 Output
- Customers are divided into meaningful clusters
- Each cluster represents a distinct customer group
- Clear visualizations of customer segments
